This is the official GitHub repository for our team's contribution (**ADMIS**) to 

# [2nd Edition FRCSyn: Face Recognition Challenge in the Era of Synthetic Data](https://frcsyn.github.io/CVPR2024.html)

* A summary paper will be published in the **[proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR) 2024](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/)**
  
* Our training code for the generative models model and face recognition models codes will be released soon.

* If you are interested in the data used in our competition, please contact us at **zzhizhou66@gmail.com**. We are currently compiling our experimental results and will soon make public the checkpoints of the recognition models trained with this dataset, along with their performance on common benchmarks such as LFW, CFP-FP, IJB-B, and more.
